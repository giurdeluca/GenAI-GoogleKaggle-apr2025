<h1>The Ass1stant D — A Meal Assistant for T1D Teens</h1>

<p><em>by a biomedical AI researcher & first-time LLM builder</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/giuraffdeluca/the-ass1stant-d-meal-assistant-for-t1d-patients" target="_blank">Kaggle notebook</a></p>

<h2>Where it all started</h2>

<p>This project began with a phone call. My 14-year-old cousin had just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. She was overwhelmed, and so was I. I wanted to help, but despite my two years in biomedical AI, I had never worked with language models. However, something about GenAI sparked my curiosity, and this time, it was personal.</p>

<p>The Gen AI Intensive Course came at the perfect time! With the expertise I gained in LLMs and agents, I set out to build something that could help her—not years from now, but right away. Something approachable and practical. A small AI companion to help her (and others like her) make smarter food choices, without sounding like a textbook or a glucose monitor.</p>

<h2>The Ass1stant D</h2>

<p>The Ass1stant D is a meal-planning assistant designed for people living with T1D. It doesn’t just suggest “healthy meals”—it considers glycemic load, fiber, insulin dosing, and the kind of questions a teenager might ask. It aims to talk like a friend who understands their biology.</p>

<p>Technically, it’s an agent-powered RAG pipeline backed by nutritional advice and custom logic for T1D-specific analysis. But behind the tech, it’s simply trying to answer: “What can I eat that won’t spike my glucose later?”</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Takes in a user profile: age, weight, insulin plan, etc.</li>
  <li>Parses food input (from ingredients or meals) and scores it for glycemic impact</li>
  <li>Suggests alternatives or confirms good choices</li>
  <li>Explains the reasoning in plain language</li>
</ul>

<h2>GenAI techniques used</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Agents:</strong> A multi-turn agent that uses reasoning and tools to walk through carb scoring, substitutions, and explanations.</li>
  <li><strong>RAG:</strong> Provides grounded answers using vector search over USDA data and hand-picked diabetes-safe recipes.</li>
  <li><strong>Function Calling:</strong> Offloads nutrition analysis, insulin ratio math, and glycemic estimation to Python functions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

<p>This was my first real dive into APIs, LangChain, Gemini, and prompt engineering. I had zero experience building agents before this project. It wasn’t smooth, but it worked. Now I know that with the right model, a good prompt, and a clear goal, GenAI can be genuinely useful—even in healthcare.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This is just an MVP. Right now, document chunks are manually selected and injected into the vector store.</li>
  <li>It's not a medical device and cannot replace a clinician or registered dietitian.</li>
  <li>Ingredient parsing and matching are simplistic for now.</li>
  <li>It assumes accurate and honest input from the user.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s next</h2>

<p>I’m already thinking about what a final version might look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a carb estimator from photo to ease carbs counting.</li>
  <li>Replace the hand-curated chunks with a full medical knowledge base—parsed, embedded, and queried with LangChain.</li>
  <li>Integrate CGM APIs for feedback loops based on real glucose response.</li>
  <li>Expose the assistant via a chat UI (and maybe voice) to make it more accessible.</li>
  <li>Add a caregiver view for shared decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>This wasn’t just an experiment in GenAI—it was a way to channel concern into something useful. If even one kid with T1D finds it helpful, that’s more than enough to make this worth it.</p>
